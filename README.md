# Knock-Knock

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to train a AI model for home-security cameras to identify visitors at front door, save the record with times, and sent notifications if needed. The software will stream the video from the security camera as input, analyze and identify visitor with trained model. The software will generate result base on the result given by the model and write it to the log file for tracking purposes. For example, it will record a carrier from UPS stopped by at 10:12am, and a carrier from USPS came to drop a package at 14:25pm. 

The main objects to identify includes:
1. Amazon delivery-man
2. UPS delivery-man
3. Fedex delivery-man
4. USPS postman
5. Pizza delivery-man
6. Package thief (if possible)

## Vision Statement
For residents or small companies/organizations, who need a way to keep track of received packages for security and organizational purposes, the Knock Knock application is an excellent surveillance system that allows its users to keep an eye on who is delivering packages at their door. Unlike the average security camera system, such as Ring, Knock Knock uses Artificial Intelligence to decipher what kind of delivery-man is at your door-step. Our product will allow users to be notified of when someone is at your door, first determining whether or not they are dropping off a package, as well as which company they are delivering from.
